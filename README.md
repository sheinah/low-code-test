# low-code-test

Python script that defines a function `get_permutations` to find unique permutations of an input string and includes example usages of this function as well as a unit test using the `unittest` module. Here's a breakdown of the structure and conventions used in the code:
1. Import Statements:
   - Import the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module to generate permutations.
   - Import the `unittest` module for testing.
2. Function Definition:
   - Define the `get_permutations` function, which takes an input string and returns a list of unique permutations of that string.
   - The function uses the `set` to remove duplicate permutations, ensuring that the result only contains unique permutations.
   - The permutations are converted to strings using a list comprehension and the `''.join(p)` method.
3. Example Usages:
   - Demonstrate the usage of the `get_permutations` function with different input strings, including single characters and longer strings.
   - Print the unique permutations for each input.
4. Unit Test Class:
   - Define a class `TestPermutations` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
   - Inside the test class, define a test method `test_permutations` to check whether the `get_permutations` function produces the expected results for a specific input string.
   - Compare the sorted result of the function with the sorted list of expected permutations and use `self.assertEqual` to assert their equality.
5. Test Runner:
   - Use the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block to run the unit tests when the script is executed directly.
   - The `unittest.main()` function runs all test methods in the defined test class.

Python function `find_odd_int` that finds the integer that appears an odd number of times in a list of integers using the XOR (^) operator. It also includes a unit test and some additional test cases. Here's a breakdown of the structure and conventions used in the code:
1. Function Definition:
   - The `find_odd_int` function takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
   - It initializes a variable `result` to 0.
   - It iterates through the elements in the input list and applies the XOR operation (`^`) between the current `result` and the current element in the list. This operation effectively cancels out pairs of identical numbers.
   - The function returns the final value of `result`, which will be the integer that appears an odd number of times in the list.
2. Unit Test Function:
   - The `test_find_odd_int` function contains several `assert` statements that check whether the `find_odd_int` function returns the expected results for different input lists.
3. Test Runner:
   - The code block with `if __name__ == "__main__"` runs the unit tests when the script is executed directly.
   - After running the tests, it prints "All tests passed!" if all the assertions pass.
4. Additional Test Cases:
   - After running the unit tests, the code also includes some additional test cases that are not part of the unit test function. These additional test cases are used to demonstrate the functionality of the `find_odd_int` function.

Python function `countSmileys` that counts the number of valid smiley faces in a list of strings. It uses regular expressions (`re` module) to match valid smiley face patterns and then counts the matches. Here's a breakdown of the structure and conventions used in the code:
1. Function Definition:
   - The `countSmileys` function takes a list of strings `arr` as input.
   - It first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns 0.
2. Regular Expression Pattern:
   - The function defines a regular expression pattern `pattern` to match valid smiley faces. The pattern includes the following elements:
     - `[:;]`: Either a colon `:` or a semicolon `;`.
     - `[-~]?`: An optional character that can be a hyphen `-` or a tilde `~`.
     - `[)D]`: Either a closing parenthesis `)` or an uppercase letter "D."
3. Using `re.findall()`:
   - The `re.findall()` function is used to find all matches of the regular expression pattern in the input list. It converts the list of strings to a single string with spaces in between and then searches for matches in that concatenated string.
4. Returning the Count:
   - The function returns the count of valid smiley faces by getting the length of the list of matches.
5. Example Test Cases:
   - The code includes example test cases that demonstrate the functionality of the `countSmileys` function. It tests the function with various input arrays, including an empty array, and prints the results.
