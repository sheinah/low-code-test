# low-code-test

Python script that defines a function `get_permutations` to find unique permutations of an input string and includes example usages of this function as well as a unit test using the `unittest` module. Here's a breakdown of the structure and conventions used in the code:
1. Import Statements:
   - Import the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module to generate permutations.
   - Import the `unittest` module for testing.
2. Function Definition:
   - Define the `get_permutations` function, which takes an input string and returns a list of unique permutations of that string.
   - The function uses the `set` to remove duplicate permutations, ensuring that the result only contains unique permutations.
   - The permutations are converted to strings using a list comprehension and the `''.join(p)` method.
3. Example Usages:
   - Demonstrate the usage of the `get_permutations` function with different input strings, including single characters and longer strings.
   - Print the unique permutations for each input.
4. Unit Test Class:
   - Define a class `TestPermutations` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
   - Inside the test class, define a test method `test_permutations` to check whether the `get_permutations` function produces the expected results for a specific input string.
   - Compare the sorted result of the function with the sorted list of expected permutations and use `self.assertEqual` to assert their equality.
5. Test Runner:
   - Use the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block to run the unit tests when the script is executed directly.
   - The `unittest.main()` function runs all test methods in the defined test class.

 
Python function `find_odd_int` that aims to find the integer in an array that appears an odd number of times. It utilizes a bitwise XOR operation to achieve this in linear time, except for the initial sorting step, which is O(n log n).
Here's an overview of the code's structure and conventions:
1. **Importing Modules:**
   - The code starts by importing the `random` module, which is used to generate random test cases.
2. **`find_odd_int` Function:**
   - This is the main function of the code.
   - It takes an array of integers as input and returns the integer that appears an odd number of times.
   - It handles both positive and negative integers and zero.
   - The function uses two variables, `result_negative` and `result_positive`, to track the results for negative and positive integers, respectively.
   - It also keeps track of how many times zero appears in the array.
   - It iterates through the sorted array, flipping the bits of integers using bitwise XOR to find the integer that appears an odd number of times.
   - Special handling is done for zero, which is counted separately.
   - Finally, it checks whether zero appears an odd number of times, and if so, returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result.
3. **`get_random_array` Function:**
   - This function generates random test cases for the `find_odd_int` function.
   - It takes optional arguments `num_pairs`, `min_i`, and `max_i` to customize the test cases.
   - It creates an array of random integers, ensures that all elements appear an even number of times, and adds one integer that appears an odd number of times.
4. **`test_find_odd_int` Function:**
   - This function contains a series of unit tests for the `find_odd_int` function.
   - It tests the function with various arrays, including random test cases generated by `get_random_array`.
   - It asserts that the function's output matches the expected results.
5. **Main Block:**
   - The code's main block runs the `test_find_odd_int` function to validate the `find_odd_int` function's correctness.
   - It also includes additional test cases to check the function with specific inputs.
   - If all tests pass, it prints "All tests passed!" to indicate the success of the tests.
6. **Print Statements:**
   - After the main block, there are several calls to the `find_odd_int` function with specific input arrays to demonstrate its functionality.
7. **Conventions and Comments:**
   - The code follows PEP 8 conventions, such as using 4 spaces for indentation and providing docstrings for functions.
   - The code contains comments that explain the purpose and functionality of various parts of the code.


Python function `countSmileys` that counts the number of valid smiley faces in a list of strings. It uses regular expressions (`re` module) to match valid smiley face patterns and then counts the matches. Here's a breakdown of the structure and conventions used in the code:
1. Function Definition:
   - The `countSmileys` function takes a list of strings `arr` as input.
   - It first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns 0.
2. Regular Expression Pattern:
   - The function defines a regular expression pattern `pattern` to match valid smiley faces. The pattern includes the following elements:
     - `[:;]`: Either a colon `:` or a semicolon `;`.
     - `[-~]?`: An optional character that can be a hyphen `-` or a tilde `~`.
     - `[)D]`: Either a closing parenthesis `)` or an uppercase letter "D."
3. Using `re.findall()`:
   - The `re.findall()` function is used to find all matches of the regular expression pattern in the input list. It converts the list of strings to a single string with spaces in between and then searches for matches in that concatenated string.
4. Returning the Count:
   - The function returns the count of valid smiley faces by getting the length of the list of matches.
5. Example Test Cases:
   - The code includes example test cases that demonstrate the functionality of the `countSmileys` function. It tests the function with various input arrays, including an empty array, and prints the results. and the second block attempts to call the function with a list containing a non-string element. Both cases are expected to raise an `AssertionError`.
